# Minimal image search
Minimal Firefox extension to search images painlessly.

## Why?
Firefox has no built-in search for image feature, and other extensions are not as minimal
as I want, so I built one.

## How to use?
When you open the image in the browser, use keyboard shortcut `Alt + Shift + S` (default), or you can set a different shortcut.

## Installation
The extension is available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimal-image-search/).

### Install from source
1. Clone this repository/[download zip](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Minimal-image-search/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your local machine.

```git
git clone https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Minimal-image-search.git
```

2. Load extension on Firefox:
Go to `about:debugging`, click `Load Temporary Add-on...`, then select `manifest.json` of the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

3. 
   - Make the extension more visible by `Pin to Toolbar`
   - Change shortcut if needed

4. Enjoy âœ¨.
