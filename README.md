# Minimal image search
Minimal Firefox extension to search images painlessly.

## Why?
Firefox has no built-in search for image feature, and other extensions are not as minimal
as I want, so I built one.

## How to use?
When you open the image in the browser, use keyboard shortcut `Alt + Shift + S` (default), or you can set a different shortcut.

## Installation
The extension is available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimal-image-search/).
